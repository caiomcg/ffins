# Installing FFmpeg

There are several ways of installing FFmpeg, you can do it through the CLI, 
downloading pre-compiled versions generated by the community or more appropriately
compiling your own version from the sources. In this tutorial we will compile a new version
from the sources, note that the installation may be different depending on the operating
system you are using. This tutorial will focus on unix systems, in particular MacOS and Linux.

## Downloading from the sources
It is important to download the appropriate version from the sources, FFmpeg has its own repository with a mirror on
github that can be found [here](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg).

On the github page you can look at the releases list as shown in the Image 01.



For this tutorial we will use the most recent release (4.1.3) as shown in the image below.


The Zip or Tar version of the release can be download directly through this website, however cloning the github project
and moving to the tag is the recommended way of doing it
